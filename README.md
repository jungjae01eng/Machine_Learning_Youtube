These codes are from Python Machine Learning Tutorial (Data Science) by Programming with Mosh on the Youtube Channel.
I used this to learn and practice Machine Learning with Python.

## Project01_Accuracy_of_the_Models
Separated the data from the music.csv dataset, first two columns (age, gender) as an "input" and the last column (genre) as an "output."
Then, split the data into two data, one for training purposes and the other for test purposes, to see the accuracy of the prediction.
