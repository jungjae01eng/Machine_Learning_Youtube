# Machine_Learning_Youtube
These codes are from Python Machine Learning Tutorial (Data Science) by Programming with Mosh on the Youtube Channel.
I used this to learn and practice Machine Learning with Python.
Each project covered diverse skills and was able to explore different types of problems.

## Project01_Accuracy_of_the_Models
Separated the data from the music.csv dataset, first two columns (age, gender) as an "input" and the last column (genre) as an "output."
Then, split the data into two data, one for training purposes and the other for test purposes, to see the accuracy of the prediction.

## Project02_Persisting_Models
Learned how to save the trained model so we can predict it without having to train the model every time we need prediction.
* If you run the code, it will create "music-recommender.joblib," and the trained model will be saved there.

## Project03_Visualizing_Decision_Tree
Learned how to make a tree diagram to visualize the steps that models take to make a prediction.
* If you run the code, it will create "music-recommender.dot." Place this dot into either VS code or Pycharm CE; then, it will show the tree diagram.
